# Keep Your Distance

An Android application that alert's the mobile device user that another wireless device is within
close proximity. It works by periodically scanning for Bluetooth, Bluetooth Low Energy, and Wi-Fi
devices, then checking if their signal strength (RSSI) is above a predefined threshold. The 
default threshold is intended to approximate ~2 metres.
